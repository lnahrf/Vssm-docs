# Found a bug?

Please open an issue [here](https://github.com/tk-ni/vssm/issues). Detailing the bug and your environment as much as you can. If you could provide reproduction steps or a repository that would be best.

I will try and answer open issues as quickly as possible, but since I'm working as a full-time developer it might take a while (so please be patient). I promise I will answer eventually.
