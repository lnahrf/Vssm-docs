# Want to contribute?

I'm honored that you would want to contribute to Vssm! I'm open to all suggestions and PR's (open issues [here](https://github.com/tk-ni/vssm/issues)).

Please keep in mind that the purpose of this library is to be extremely light-weight and simple. I probably won't merge new features unless it's necessary.
