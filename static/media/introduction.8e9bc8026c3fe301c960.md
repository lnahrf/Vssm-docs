# Very Small State Manager (Vssm)

A very small and oversimplified state manager written in pure Javascript.

This documentation site was made using Vssm!
Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/tk-ni/Vssm-docs).

## Why?

Vssm was created from a personal need for a small, fast and basic state management library. It exists to give the simplest solution to small frontend projects, so you won't have to install and configure robust libraries just to define some variables.

Vssm has **_no dependencies_** and it weighs **_2kb_** in it's minified version.
It's so small it's not even there. You can just plug it in your current project and start managing your state.

_Keep in mind that Vssm is not here to replace popular state management libraries, it's here to give a tiny, native solution for projects that wish to stay relatively small, and still enjoy state management._

### Vssm is

- Extremely light-weight
- A Plug-and-Play solution
- Super easy to get the hang of
- Has no actions, reducers or complicated cases
- Dependency-less
